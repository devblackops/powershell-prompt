# powershell-prompt

This is my prompt. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This prompt function and related settings are just a small portion of my PowerShell [profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.1). Feel free to copy and adjust as you see fit.

## Requirements

> This prompt **requires** a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to be installed and selected in order to show glyphs/icons correctly. If you don't have a nerd font selected, icons will show as an empty box.
